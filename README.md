# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Overview

The goal of this project was to build a html webpage that would display the results of various eye-witness reports of UFO sightings.  The webpage needed the capability to filter based on given inputs and dynamically display the filtered results.

##### [Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search UFO Sightings](UFO-level_1/index.html)

##### [Level 2: Automatic Table and Date, City, and State Search](UFO-level_2/index.html)

-Using JavaScript ([app.js](UFO-level_1/static/js/app.js)), the data contained in the file [data.js](UFO-level_1/static/js/data.js)) was rendered into a visible table on the html index page.

-A function was created that filtered results based on the form input and returned the corresponding results on the page.
